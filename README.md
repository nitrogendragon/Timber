# Timber
C++ SFML course Project from John Horton
Just a project based on the above mentioned course C++ Game Tutorial on LinkedIn for practice / learning purposes.

Instructions:
Download repository open in your preferred C++ code editor (recommend Visual Studio as everything should be set up properly and I dont know
what will happen in other editors).
Either run through Visual Studio or set up an executable file and you are good to go.

Note I don't have any rights or anything special for the music, just added because I like the song.
